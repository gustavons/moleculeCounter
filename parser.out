Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> factor IGUAL factor
Rule 2     term -> ELEMENTO
Rule 3     expression -> term
Rule 4     term -> term HASHTAG factor
Rule 5     expression -> term SIFRAO factor

Terminals, with rules where they appear

ELEMENTO             : 2 6
HASHTAG              : 4
IGUAL                : 1
SIFRAO               : 5
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear
